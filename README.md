# Buffer

Here we go with the replica of the website Buffer. With the skills and knowledge acquired over the period of 4 weeks, we were able to build the front-end with the bit of functionality of the Buffer Website.

Technology Stack we used in building this Project :
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

We as a team worked on building the pre-login pages, login and signup pages. Further, we are focusing on coming up with the further functioning of the website and implementing features which uses promises, localstorage,... etc.
